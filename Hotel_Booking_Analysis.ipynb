        "This project analyzed hotel booking data to gain insights and make recommendations to improve business performance. The analysis revealed several key findings:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. City hotels are more popular than resort hotels, but have a higher cancellation rate.\n",
        "2. Repeat guests are more likely to have previous bookings that were not canceled.\n",
        "3. The majority of bookings come through TA/TO (Tour Agent/Tour Operator), followed by Direct and Corporate.\n",
        "4. The percentage of booking cancellation is higher for TA/TO than for Direct and Corporate bookings.\n",
        "5. The average lead time for resort hotels is higher than for city hotels.\n",
        "6. The average ADR (Average Daily Rate) for city hotels is higher than for resort hotels.\n",
        "7. The majority of guests are transient (82.4%).\n",
        "8. The optimal stay in both types of hotels is less than 7 days.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on these findings, several recommendations were made to the client to achieve their business objectives:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Increase bookings by targeting marketing campaigns to countries with the highest number of guests and offering discounts and promotions.\n",
        "2. Decrease cancellations by improving communication with guests and offering flexible cancellation policies.\n",
        "3. Increase customer retention by implementing a loyalty program and providing excellent customer service.\n",
        "4. Extend stays by offering discounts for longer stays and creating packages that include activities and attractions in the local area.\n",
        "\n",
        "By implementing these recommendations, the hotel can improve its business performance and achieve its objectives.\n"
