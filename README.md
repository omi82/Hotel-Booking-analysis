# Hotel-Booking-Analysis-EDA

# **Project Summary -**
This project focuses on the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a hotel booking dataset to derive valuable insights into customer booking behavior and preferences. The primary objectives are to understand trends, identify key factors influencing bookings, and provide recommendations for optimizing hotel revenue and occupancy.

# Key Objectives

*1. Define Business Objectives:*

- Set clear goals for the analysis, understanding its purpose and expected outcomes.

*2. Data Cleaning:*

- Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency.
- Create a clean and well-structured dataset for analysis.
  
*3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):*

- Analyze booking trends based on various factors such as hotel type, arrival month, lead time, etc.
- Identify relationships between features using statistical methods and visualizations.
- Generate new variables to capture additional insights.

*4. Presentation of Findings:*

- Summarize key observations from the EDA.
- Provide recommendations for improving hotel booking strategies.


# Key Activities

**Data Cleaning:**

*Handling Missing Values:*

- Use appropriate methods such as imputation or removal to handle missing data.
 
*Treating Outliers:*

- Identify and address outliers that might affect the analysis.
  
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

*Booking Trends Analysis:*

- Explore how booking patterns vary based on hotel type, seasons, or other relevant factors.
  
*Feature Relationships:*

- Use statistical methods and visualizations to identify correlations and dependencies between features.
  
*New Variables Creation:*

# Conclusion

This project analyzed hotel booking data to gain insights and make recommendations to improve business performance. The analysis revealed several key findings:

1. City hotels are more popular than resort hotels, but have a higher cancellation rate.
2. Repeat guests are more likely to have previous bookings that were not canceled.
3. The majority of bookings come through TA/TO (Tour Agent/Tour Operator), followed by Direct and Corporate.
4. The percentage of booking cancellation is higher for TA/TO than for Direct and Corporate bookings.
5. The average lead time for resort hotels is higher than for city hotels.
6. The average ADR (Average Daily Rate) for city hotels is higher than for resort hotels.
7. The majority of guests are transient (82.4%).
8. The optimal stay in both types of hotels is less than 7 days.

Based on these findings, several recommendations were made to the client to achieve their business objectives:

1. Increase bookings by targeting marketing campaigns to countries with the highest number of guests and offering discounts and promotions.
2. Decrease cancellations by improving communication with guests and offering flexible cancellation policies.
3. Increase customer retention by implementing a loyalty program and providing excellent customer service.
4. Extend stays by offering discounts for longer stays and creating packages that include activities and attractions in the local area.

By implementing these recommendations, the hotel can improve its business performance and achieve its objectives.
